# Features

The website consists of one page with the following features:

## Header

The header contains the logo of the website.

## Game area

The game area contains two different contents depending on the stage of the game - one intro screen and one game screen:

* The intro screen (including, from top to bottom):
    * A text area:
        * This section displays a welcome message to the user explaining the game and its rules
    * A button area:
        * This section includes a button to start the game
* The game screen (including, from top to bottom):
    * A result area: 
        * This section displays the result of each round of the game including the rule behind the result.
    * A hands area: 
        * This section displays the rock, paper and scissors hands used in the game with the user's hand choice on the left and the random computer hand on the right. 
        * The default hands displayed when the user enters the game screen are two rock hands and these are later swapped to match the user's active choice and the random choice generated by the computer.
    * A controls area:
         * This section includes a CTA for the user to make a choice between rock, paper, and scissors by clicking on either of their three buttons. When DOM content has loaded and the user clicks on one of the buttons the functions of the game are called to initiate the game.

## Score area

Below the game area is the score area keeping track of the results of each round of the game. This section includes scores for won, lost, and draw that are incremented after each round depending on the result. 

## Footer
